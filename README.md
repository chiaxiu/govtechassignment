## Instructions

## Description
A simple tic-tac-toe game created using react.js on the front-end. As this is my time learning and using Javascript/React.js, I could only create the front-end portion of the assignment due to time constraints. Given more time, I would create the backend portion with Node.js with Express, use socket.io for communicating between the frontend and backend and use MongoDB database to store the necessary game information.

## Architecture
The main component is "App.js" and it is built on other components from the 'components' folder.
